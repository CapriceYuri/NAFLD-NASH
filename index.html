                        - As per restriction due to IB6, they have a maximum offerring potential of ~$24M. In which, ~$15M has already been allocated; ~$5M in stocks and ~$10M in warrants as per their offering.</p><br>
                    - As per IB6, the restriction also have a duration of 12 months. Given the offering closed in October 2023, it would implied possible offering amounting of the remaining ~$9M from now to October 2024.<br><br>
                    - Also need to take in consideration that, as warrants exercised, the OS will increased and will drastically decrease the SP needed to satisfy the $75M MC condition. Once lifted, their ability to raise substantial capital will greatly increase and with no more limitations.

                    <p class="card-text">- Strategic move from AUPH's major shareholders, strenghtening their position in selling the company to BP. Due to this ongoing tug-of-war between BOD and major shareholders, two BOD members has been resigned early this year.<br><br>
                        - Important to note, there has been reports of nepotism in AUPH's hierarchy involving the Chairman and CEOs, which lead to self-enrichment throught compensations and benefits. The largest shareholder of the time, ILJIN SNT, issued a statement to potentially re-established leadership for shareholders's benefits.Nonetheless, Robert Foster was one the mentioned for the role.<br><br>
                        - "ILJIN Chairman Issues Open Letter to Aurinia Shareholders" - <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190621005228/en/ILJIN-Chairman-Issues-Open-Letter-to-Aurinia-Shareholders" target="_blank" class="link-underline-light">Link</a><br><br>
                        - As per AUPH's SEC filing, it stated <span class="text-success">"the Company had $0.5 million and $6.4 million of current and non-current liabilities related to Dr. Foster, respectively"</span> and <span class="text-success">"Dr. Foster was entitled to receive 2% of royalty licensing revenue for royalties received on the sale of voclosporin by licensees and/or 0.3% of net sales of voclosporin sold directly by the Company"</span>. Given the healthy relationship between Foster and the major shareholder, as well as, the founder of Voclosporin. His addition to AUPH's BOD is no stranger.<br><br>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        - Hepion will likely be acquired by interested parties. Given their balance sheet, they lack significant leveraging power in any deal discussions. This includes partnerships and colloaborations.<br><br>
                        - The latest PO shows that HEPA is not willing to give up majority, this explain the restrictions placed on the "BUYER". Given the current outlook, it won't be long for the next PO. Possibly due to GLP pre-clinical study or ASCEND interim.<br><br>
                        - It's important to discuss the lack of communications and information. Information such as DSMB interims has been clearly misinformed; <br>
                        It was stated that two DSMB interim will be conducted, the first being NIMs and the second being biopsy. But as things unfolded, it seems that there will be 4 DSMB interims separated by safety & efficacy.<br><br>
                        - The first DSMB safety interim completed in June 2023, assuming the second being conducted in Q1/24.<br><br>
                        - The first DSMB efficacy interim will be assumed in Q1/24 and the second in the second half of 2024. This will implied that the DBL is until patient trial completion.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        - GLP pre-clinical study will be interesting. If the study yield positive results, this will open the bridge between HEPA and some BP's investigational drugs. Overall, this may be overshadowed by their financial situation if they haven't find a solution by then.<br><br>
                        - The first DSMB interim, will once again, reiterate their previous studies and data unless they have some biopsy available. The data will be 6-months duration, whereas ALTITUDE was already 4 months duration. Therefore, don't expect big surprise from the data.<br><br>
                        - Based on the current outlook, their options are very limited. It's not out of possiblities that some third-parties will further hinder them to take-over or acquire.<br><br>
                        - Another possible option is to take on debts and loans. Having a credit-line will provide working capitals without issuing shares and increasing OS.
