                        Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Multiple Myeloma, Kidney Fibrosis, Non-Alcoholic
                        Steatohepatitis (NASH), Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), Liver Fibrosis and Liver
                        Cirrhosis.
                        <br><br>
                        As a novel molecule chemically derived from a pharmacological class of therapeutic drugs used
                        clinically for over 35 years, Rencofilstat has thus far demonstrated an excellent safety
                        profile in all animal and clinical studies to date. Thanks to multiple, diverse mechanisms of
                        action and its accumulation in the liver, Rencofilstat has demonstrated efficacy in distinct
                        animal models of NASH. These findings are consistent with in vitro studies documenting
                        mechanisms of action as an antiviral agent, protection from cellular stress
                        and death, anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-cancer activities.
                        <br><br>
                        Rencofilstat is positioned to become a highly versatile therapeutic drug for the most
                        prominent liver diseasesof our time. No other marketed drugs or NASH drug candidates in
                        development address all these mechanisms.

                    <p class="card-text">Rencofilstat binds to Cyclophilin A, which blocks the binding of Cyclophilin A
                        to specific receptors on inflammatory cells, decreasing infiltration of the cells into the
                        tissue and production of harmful inflammatory molecules, resulting in reduced inflammatory
                        damage to the liver.<br><br>
                        Cyclophilin A specifically is found in the cytoplasm of cells and is known to be involved in various biological processes, including protein folding, intracellular trafficking, immune responses, and signal transduction. One of its notable functions is its interaction with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A. This drug binds to cyclophilin A and forms a complex that inhibits the activity of calcineurin, a key enzyme in the immune response. By inhibiting calcineurin, cyclosporine A helps suppress the immune system, making it useful for preventing organ transplant rejection and treating certain autoimmune diseases.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, cyclophilin A has been implicated in various disease processes. It has been associated with inflammatory and immune responses, and its levels have been found to be elevated in certain diseases, including viral infections, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Research is ongoing to better understand the roles of cyclophilin A in health and disease, and it continues to be a topic of interest in both basic science and clinical research.

                    <p class="card-text">Rencofilstat blocks the actions of Cylcophilin B, an important regulator of
                        collagen production in stealate cells. This leads to a reduction in collagen secretions and
                        fibrotic scarring, a primary goal in the treatment of NASH.<br><br>
                        One of the well-known roles of cyclophilin B is its involvement in the folding and maturation of collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix that provides structural support to various tissues in the body. Cyclophilin B assists in the proper folding of collagen molecules in the ER before they are secreted from the cell.<br><br>
                        In addition to its role in collagen maturation, cyclophilin B has been linked to various cellular processes, including protein trafficking, calcium homeostasis, and immune responses. It has also been associated with certain disease conditions, such as fibrosis and autoimmune disorders.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Rencofilstat binds to Cyclophiln D which prevents or reverses the formation of
                        pores in the mitochondrial membrane that cause mitochondria to rupture, allowing mitochondria to
                        resume normal energy production, and enabling the survival of liver cells.<br><br>
                        One of the most prominent roles of cyclophilin D is its involvement in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a complex structure that spans the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. The mPTP plays a critical role in regulating the permeability of the mitochondrial membranes, particularly during cellular stress and apoptosis (programmed cell death).<br><br>Cyclophilin D interacts with the mPTP and its modulation can influence the opening of the pore. When the mPTP opens, it can lead to the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of molecules that are normally sequestered within the mitochondria, such as cytochrome c. This release can trigger the activation of apoptosis, a controlled process that eliminates damaged or unnecessary cells.<br><br>
                        The role of cyclophilin D and the mPTP is complex and is associated with various physiological and pathological processes, including cell survival, oxidative stress, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury (such as occurs during heart attacks), and more. Researchers have been investigating the potential of targeting cyclophilin D and the mPTP as a therapeutic strategy for various conditions, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.</p>
